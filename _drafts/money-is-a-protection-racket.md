I've been pretty interested in (or maybe "obsessed by") [Modern Monetary Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory) for a few years now. It took me a long time to feel like I understood it, even though the theory is really not as complicated as it might first appear. It's just that it's so different from the mythos we're all brought up with that it requires a re-wiring of the brain.

Although there are many possible implications of MMT, and economists will [argue ad nauseum](https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/433658-setting-the-record-straight-on-gnd-and-modern-monetary-theory/) about how it impacts specific monetary policy, MMT is really a redefinition of what money *is*.

I just read an article by Cory Doctorow, ["Moneylike"](https://scribe.rip/moneylike-d20f8279a72e), which explains the true nature of money better than anything I'd read before. A taster:

> I’d bring my fat cows and you’d bring your champion-laying hens ...
> But this isn’t a history, it’s a folk-tale. A legend. ... 
> The solution was elegant — and terrible. Soldiers were paid in coin, minted and controlled by the state, which punished counterfeiters with the most terrible torments. Conquered farmers were taxed in coin, on penalty of violence and expropriation.

We've all been told a myth that money is a grassroots phenomenon, that people created money as a good way to trade. The story goes that trade is a fundemental need of all human society, and money is needed to make trade more efficient.

Historical evidence instead shows us that the first coins were created by states, primarily as a way to demand tax from farmers. This tax requirement to pay tax was backed up by military force. As in, pay us 20 gold coins every month or we'll kill your family and take your farm - just like the Mafia. This was what fundamentally created the need for money.

Any currency is only as real as the peril that not having it
