description: Mahnke's masterful mantras
title: Peter's parting principles
---

My boss and mentor of over 8 years, Peter Mahnke, moved on from Canonical two months ago.

Peter has led the web & design team in one form or another for the best part of a decade. He's watched it grow massively in size, responsibilities and ambitions, And every team member still carries a lot of respect and affection for Peter.

On his last day, Peter dropped 10 pearls of wisdom for success and fulfillment at work. I think they are great advice, and really capture the essence of what made him a unique and subtly effective leader.

Here's a link to [his presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-oySTHwbOKI5kKm2oK2CrGZVnJUF1yCPAAbs-oQdtqk/edit?usp=drivesdk) (I've only removed photos). I'm also listing each point below, with a little extra commentary of my own.

## Take notes

> The person that takes the notes is the person people go to and gets to set the actions

Writing things down is powerful. A meeting with no record is lost in the fog of the past, wasting everyone's time. If you take notes, a few things happen:

- everyone is grateful to you
- you become the authority on the meeting
- your understanding of the being becomes the official record of the meeting

## Make friends

> People move in their careers a lot these days, make friends immediately and keep friends after they leave.
