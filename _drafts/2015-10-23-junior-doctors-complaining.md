Junior doctors are [probably going to strike][] against changes to their contracts. But most of the public don't really know what a junior doctor is, let alone why they might want to strike. So I'm going to try to explain what I know about the issues.

Disclaimer: I'm not actually a doctor, I'm just [a web developer][]. But my wife is a "junior" doctor (an ST3 [anaesthetist][]), and so I know a fair bit about the issues. I'll try to stick to facts here, but if I get anything wrong, please correct me in the comments (please provide references if you can).

What is a "junior" doctor
===

["Junior" doctors][] make up 60% of [all NHS doctors][], and will include most doctors that you've met.

The somewhat confusing term refers to any graduate doctor until they fully complete their training, potentially 9 or more years later.  Almost any doctor who isn't yet a consultant is a junior doctor.

This means that this change in contract effects the majority of doctors in the country.

How much do junior doctors earn?
===

This is a somewhat complex question. Because "junior" doctors have anything from 0 to over 9 years of experience, their pay varies by their grade. But NHS.uk [explains it fairly well][]:

> All doctors in training earn a basic salary and may be paid an additional supplement depending on their working pattern.  
> In the most junior hospital trainee post (Foundation Year 1) the basic starting salary is £22,636. This increases in Foundation Year 2 to £28,076. For a doctor in specialist training the basic salary is between £30,002 and £47,175.
