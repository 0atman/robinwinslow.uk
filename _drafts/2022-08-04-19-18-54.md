title: Is the internet everything we hoped for?
---

As a teenager in the 90s, I was really excited about the internet. Growing up, I felt that it's ability to connect people and unlock human progress was simply a given.

And I definitely wasn't alone. The democratising power of the world wide web, and its boundless technological potential, were being discussed everywhere. Now everyone could truly have a democratic voice. Now the world's knowledge could be at everyone's fingertips.

New exciting companies grew, that did away with the puritanical formalities if the old guard. They were going to "think different" and "do no evil". They provided email for free, and put shiny knowledge portals in everyone's pocket.

Then came the ravages of the next couple of decades. It turned out that the price for free services had been [our souls][0]. That "do no evil" apparently meant [building smarter weapons][2]. Silicon valley [corrupts internet policy][3], and [enables massacres][4].

Far from empowering people and bringing peace and prosperity on the world, the internet has created bigger monopolies than ever. It has made us [more divided][6] and in a [mental health crisis][5].

From today's perspective, who could possibly argue that the internet is a force for good?
