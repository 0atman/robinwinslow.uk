title: MMT and decentralisation

Yesterday I gave a small talk about Modern Monetary Theory. At the time, I said it was, for me, "a grand unifying theory of politics". And I meant it - it really helps a lot of things fall into place for me, when thinking about policy, public opinion, political strategy.. I'm hoping to write about this more.

But there's an inescapable fact of MMT that kind of disturbs me and that I need to think through. MMT fundamentally redefines money, and in doing so, it makes the centrality of the state unavoidable.

There's a coalition of right-leaning people who are strongly against tax - businesses and the wealthy have clear incentives, but financial libertarians oppose tax on principle. The principle in question is that the government shouldn't be intervening in people's lives, and by taking tax from the people the government is intervening.

Under the conventional understanding of money, this therefore leads to a never-ending left-right struggle, between "social justice" people wanting to tax more to pay for social programs, and "freedom" people who want the government to leave them alone and not take their money.

MMT's definition of money renders this entire argument moot. It says all money originates from government, and must return to government. Government can create, or destroy, as much as it likes. Effectively, your money isn't your own, it's the government's. They could tax you or inflate your money out of existence as they like because they set all of the rules. It's rather silly to complain about the government taking some of your money back in tax because they didn't have to even give you the money in the first place. It's never really been yours. The entire money system belongs to the government, and they simply let you use it.

I am, as I said, convinced by this description of money. But it really brings the power of Government into stark relief.

Now. I consider myself super left wing. Looking at [Wikipedia's definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics), that tracks:

> **Left-wing politics** describes the range of [political ideologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology#Political_ideologies) that support and seek to achieve [social equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_equality) and [egalitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism), often in opposition to [social hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_hierarchy).

The left is often associated with big government, with many considering socialism or communism to be the extreme. Both are usually associated (perhaps unfairly) with an all-powerful state, which ends up being their main critiques.

I totally sympathise with these fears of a big powerful government. The government is the instigator of the biggest abuses and atroceties, the worst systemic bias and oppression. I much prefer local control and decentralisation. I suppose something like [anarcho-syndicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism) might be more my ideal for society.

MMT again basically says that the very idea of "small government" is pointless. Government is everywhere, in everything. Those who think they're free from government control are simply deluded.

In fact, this is basically consistent with social contract theory in the [Hobbesian understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes#Leviathan). Modern states are a bargain between the people ruled and the rulers, whereby the people give up control over their lives for the security provided by the state. They grant the state a monopoly on violence. This seems very consistent with MMT, given that this monopoly on violence is also the basis for how money is created.

So I can see that perhaps the Real Politik way to look at this is to accept that much of the shape of our lives is dictated by the state, and so all we can do is in turn try to shape the state (through democratic participation).

But what if I don't believe in centralisation? That there can never be a central authority that knows how to look after everyone? How does that sort of idea fit in with MMT?
