The Internet is amazing. It provides access to a very large proportion of all of human knowledge. Given that huge diversity of available information, it's a little shocking how narrow and similar the easily findable information is. Here I'm going to explain how to discover the deeper and more hidden parts of the web, for a richer information discovery experience.

## Basic internet access

The basic ability to browse the Internet is now available to [about 63% of the world's population](https://datareportal.com/global-digital-overview), a proportion which grows every year. This is really good news. Most people access the internet with mobile phones, with laptop and desktop computers more common in more wealthy nations.

The simplest way to consistently access the internet is with a subscription to a fixed or mobile internet provider. However, if you don't have your own subscription, you may well still be able to get access in [a number of ways](https://nordvpn.com/blog/get-free-wifi/):

- Free wifi at coffee shops
- The computers at public libraries
- Use a friend's wifi hotspot
- Connect to open home wifi networks
