title: Remote work is different
---

While the industry-wide battle over whether to allow working from home rages on, my company remains fully committed to 100% remote. That is not without its problems.

Canonical has been globally distributed and 90% remote since its founding in 2004. But until the pandemic, my team was one of the few exceptions.

Many years ago, the head of design convinced [Mark](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth) (or was it [Jane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Silber)?) that the design discipline required designers to physically stand around whiteboards, move post-its around and lay out large design prints on tables.

Shortly after the fledgling webteam was formed, it was merged with the design team to ensure presentational excellence. As our team grew and our tech matured, we became a significant engineering team. But unlike the vast majority of engineers across the company, we were all based in the London office.

As we now emerge from the pandemic, the story throughout the industry and world is one of workers wanting remote flexibility and senior managers and CEOs trying to force them back into the office. Our experience was basically the opposite:

Despite many in our team remaining attached to the office, the mandate came from the top that we had to try to make remote work. Unless the web & design team catastrophically failed at remote work through the pandemic, we would not be returning to the office.

The office was too expensive, the inefficiencies were too great. There was no longer any way to justify it.
