title: Are story points a waste of time?
---

*Disclaimer: The opinion I'm about to give is, like most such expressions, a sort of trial balloon; a test of the Agile climate. It's my honest opinion based on my reasonable experience of Agile planning, but that experience is of course limited. There may be plenty of teams out there beyond my experience who make story points work. I'd honestly like to know, so please let me know.*

## What are story points?

First, let's define our terms.

Work to create software is not predictable. It's a creative endeavour where we discover the shape of the best solution as we work on it. So it's not possible to know for sure how long a piece of work will take in advance.

Story points are used in Agile planning methodologies like *Scrum* where tasks are scheduled into *iterations* of e.g. 2 weeks.

In this method, we try to measure the rate at which work happened in past iterations, so we can predict how much work we can do in future iterations.

Story points are numerical sizes given to each task. They have no direct relationship to units of time, but instead have meaning only relative to each other. Hence, three 2-point tasks should take the same time as two 3-point tasks.

In aggregate, the sum of all the story points assigned to tasks in a single iteration make up that iteration's *velocity*. The idea is that over time the velocities of our iterations will start to stabilise, allowing us to predict the amount of work we can do in a future iteration.

To reflect their imprecise nature, story points usually follow the fibonacci scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21). This is because the larger a task is, the less likely we are able to estimate it accurately, so estimations get less and less granular as tasks get bigger.

There is a slightly different flavor of story points called "t-shirt sizing". Here, tasks are estimated as "small", "medium", "large" and sometimes "extra large". This reduces the number of options for estimating tasks a bit, but ultimately these sizes get converted into numbers for calculating velocity, so it's not much different from story points.
