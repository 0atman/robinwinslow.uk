Today, Theresa May [makes another attempt][bbc-may] to turn us all against the evil migrants (and, by extension, refugees).

A conservative standpoint
===

This is not a logical decision, it is inherently an emotional and political one. And being against immigration is a classically conservative standpoint. Migrants always signify change. The more new people you let into the country, the less predictable the social mix. Society will evolve and change to respond to the diversity of backgrounds.

The conservative steriotype is against that sort of uncertainty, or that level of change. Things should remain within defined parameters so that we can keep change to a minimum.

"It's all about the economy"
===

Of course, this conservative government tries to run on a platform of economic stability. So 

In a sense, therefore, May's speech is quite transparent about her point of view:

> "But even if we could manage all the consequences of mass immigration, Britain does not need net migration in the hundreds of thousands every year."
> 
> She will cite statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the House of Lords economic affairs committee which she says shows the net economic and fiscal effect of high immigration is "close to zero".
> 
> "So there is no case, in the national interest, for immigration of the scale we have experienced over the last decade."

It is really telling that May responds to this lack of economic effects from migration by saying "there's no case for immigration". I would rather say:

> there's no case against immigration
