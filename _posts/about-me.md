title: about me

I'm an experienced web developer and team leader with wide-ranging expertise and interests. I enjoy finding elegant solutions within complex systems, and I [care deeply](/2013/05/30/why-i-love-the-internet/) about communications technology.

I want to be a part of a progressive and ambitious organisation who truly care about their members and their customers.

I believe the best work is done by small, focused teams of empowered and committed individuals evolving towards a common goal.

I believe that the most valuable ideas are reached through fostering a spirit of diversity, openness and experimentation. 

I believe a company is an organisation of individuals for the good of those individuals and the good of the human race. Company profits should never come before either concern.

I believe that effective communication is critically important in all areas of life.

*something about transparency*
