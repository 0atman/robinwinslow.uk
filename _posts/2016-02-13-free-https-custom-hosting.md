There has been a [growing][] [movement][] to get all websites to use SSL
connections where possible. Nowadays, Google even [uses it as a criterion][] for
ranking websites.

I've written before about [how to host an HTTPS website for free with StartSSL
and OpenShift][free-https]. However, StartSSL is very hard to use and provides
very basic certificates, and setting up a website on OpenShift is a fairly technical
undertaking.

There now exists [a much simpler way to setup an HTTPS website][simple-https] with
[CloudFlare][] and [GitHub Pages][]. This only works for static sites.

If your site is more complicated and needs a database or dynamic functionality,
then look at my other post about [the OpenShift solution][free-https]. However,
if a static site works for you, read on.

GitHub Pages
===

As most developers will be aware by now, GitHub offer a fantastic free
static website hosting solution in [GitHub Pages][].

All you have to do is [put your HTML files in the `gh-pages` branch][gh-pages-setup] of one of
your repositories and they will be served as a website at
`{username}.github.io/{project-name}`.

And all files are passed through the
[Jekyll][] parser first, so if you want to split up your HTML into templates
you can.

Websites on `github.io` also [support HTTPS][], so you can serve your site up
at `https://{username}.github.io/{project-name}` if you want.

GitHub Pages also [support custom domains][] (still for free). Just add a `CNAME`
file to the repository with your domain name in it - e.g.
`mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk` - and then go and setup the [DNS CNAME][]
to point to `{username}.github.io`.

The only thing you can't do directly with GitHub Pages is offer HTTPS
on your custom domain - e.g. `https://mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk`. This is where
CloudFlare comes in.

CloudFlare
===

CloudFlare offer a really quite impressive free DNS and CDN service. Of course
there are paid plans, but I myself can't see why you'd need one. This free
service includes some really impressive offerings, the first two of which
are really helpful here:

- [Free automatic HTTPS for your domain][]
- [HTTP Strict Transport Security][cloudflare-hsts] (HSTS)
- [Page Rules][cloudflare-rules]
- [DNSSEC][cloudflare-dnssec]
- [CNAME flattening][cloudflare-alias]
- ["Always online" protection][]
- [A firewall][] to protect against DDOS attacks

Because CloudFlare are a CDN *and* a DNS host, they can do the HTTPS negotiation
for you. They've taken advantage of this to provide you with a free HTTPS
certificate to encrypt communication between your users and their cached site.

First simply setup your DNS with CloudFlare to point to `{username}.github.io`,
and allow CloudFlare to cache the site.

Between CloudFlare and your host the connection doesn't have to be encrypted,
but I would certainly suggest that it still should be. But crucially for us,
this encrypted connection doesn't actually need a *valid* HTTPS certificate. To
enable this we should select the "Full" (rather than "Flexible" or "Strict")
option.

Et voila! You now have an encrypted custom domain in front of
GitHub Pages completely for free!

Ensuring all visitors use HTTPS
===

To make our site properly secure, we need to ensure all users are sent
to the HTTPS site (`https://mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk`) instead of the HTTP
one (`http://mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk`).

Setting up a page rule
---

The first step to get visitors to use HTTPS is to send a [301 redirect][]
from `http://mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk` to `https://mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk`.

Although this is not supported with GitHub Pages, it [can be achieved][] with
CloudFlare page rules.

Just add a page rule for `http://*{your-domain.com}/*` (e.g. `http://*robinwinslow.uk/*`)
and turn on "Always use HTTPS":

![CloudFlare always use HTTPS page rule](http://i.imgur.com/1l6tyIAg.png)

Now we can check that our domain is redirecting users to HTTPS
by inspecting the headers:

``` bash
$ curl -I mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
...
Location: https://mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk/
```

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
---

To protect our users from [man-in-the-middle attacks][], we should also
turn on [HSTS with CloudFlare][] (still for free).
If you're using a subdomain (e.g. `mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk`),
remember to enable "Apply HSTS policy to subdomains".

![CloudFlare: HSTS setting](http://i.imgur.com/tYam5yng.png)

This will tell [modern browsers][] to always use the HTTPS protocol for this domain.

``` bash
$ curl -I https://mytestwebsite.robinwinslow.uk
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains; preload
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

That's it!

You now have an incredibly quick and easy way to put a fully secure website
online in minutes, totally for free!
