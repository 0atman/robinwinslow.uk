<p>Another re-post from Wordpress (2011-12-13). A very short summary of some good things to think about for website performance.</p>&#13;
<p><!-- more --></p>&#13;
<p><strong>Design performance</strong></p>&#13;
<ul><li>Write the whole page design in CSS (no images) if at all possible</li>&#13;
<li>Mobile-first (with no images at all)</li>&#13;
<li>Design the page so all *all* images could be lazy-loaded without the page looking stupid</li>&#13;
<li>Obviously don't include unnecessary elements in the page</li>&#13;
</ul><p><strong>Architecture</strong></p>&#13;
<ul><li>Lazy-load *all* images, depending on visibility</li>&#13;
<li>Serve all files yourself - then you can bundle them up into a single request</li>&#13;
<li>Use sprites wherever possible</li>&#13;
<li>Try to have *one* request for all JS, and one for all CSS.</li>&#13;
</ul>
