<div>I use flash block, so I couldn't even see the close button. I had to use developer tools to delete the overlay elements to interact with the page properly.</div>&#13;
<div></div>&#13;
<div>Thank you so much for removing it. Please please please don't ever use that type of ad again, and I'll be a loyal Wired supporter.</div>&#13;
<div></div>&#13;
<div>Cheers</div>&#13;
