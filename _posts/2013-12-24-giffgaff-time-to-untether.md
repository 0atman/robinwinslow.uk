I've been using GiffGaff for over a year now. Today I say this for the first time:

So now I'm offline for a few minutes - so I'm using that time to write this blog post as a first-step to switching provider.

Problems with GiffGaff
===

Over the years, there have been a lot of problems with GiffGaff:

- They have had several complete network outages for several hours
- Sometimes when there hasn't been an outage, I've seen really weird behaviour
- Their international charges are really high
- Sometimes I run out of credit without realising it and find myself unable to make calls for a while

These issues occur just often enough to be quite annoying, but not quite often enough to be a deal breaker.

The redeeming feature
===

The redeeming feature of GiffGaff was always the internet. The speeds are pretty good, they genuinely give you unlimited data - in that I use *a lot* and they've never pulled me up on it.

And while it's true that their terms of service say you can't tether, I tether often (on trains, in coffee shops, when my home internet is down for some reason etc.) and it's so very useful to be able to do so.

I'm leaving GiffGaff
===

So if I can't tether, I'm afraid, on balance, GiffGaff is just no longer worth it. It might be true that no other provider provides as good quality unlimited internet at the same price, but I'm sure I can find one that provides fairly high usage and doesn't mind me tethering.

When I've picked a new provider, I'll update this post.
