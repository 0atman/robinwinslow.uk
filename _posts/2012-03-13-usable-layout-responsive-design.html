<p>I originally wrote this post in June 2010 on my Wordpress blog. I like to think it was before the internet caught onto the idea of responsive design. I'm now re-posting it on Tumblr (My wordpress has beenÂ decommissioned).<!-- more --></p>&#13;
<p>I was playing around with "usable layout" as I called it, the main features being:</p>&#13;
<ul><li>The main content area is the right width for easy reading (set in "em"s) - see http://www.maxdesign.com.au/articles/em/</li>&#13;
<li>Right and left columns wrap to above/below the main content when there is no longer space for them</li>&#13;
</ul><p>Here are my initial designs:</p>&#13;
<ul><li>http://static.robinwinslow.co.uk/usable-layout/2-column.html</li>&#13;
<li>http://static.robinwinslow.co.uk/usable-layout/3-column.html</li>&#13;
</ul><p>I've since made other designs that follow the same idea:</p>&#13;
