I have many interests, but I think there are two common thread running through them all:
- I care deeply, fundamentally about fairness and equality
- I am very interested in complex systems

"Complex systems" sounds extremely abstract, but I think it really is the core of my academic interest. I like mapping systems in my head, seeing the nodes; seeing the ways they interact with each other. I like working out how to create elegant systems and optimal systemic solutions for solving problems.

This leads my in two directions:

1. I love technology. Technology, along with all the problems it's trying to solve, creates and makes use of myriad systems and systemic structures. I love thinking and understanding these.
2. I love social systems and social science. People are complex, and there are extremely complex and subtle rules governing how they think and how the interact in a social systems. I love thinking about and understanding this.

Running through all the mini projects and interests that flow from my interest in systems is my deep desire for global fairness and equality. I believe that technology has the capacity to be a great equaliser. It can empower individuals extremely cheaply and facilitate communication and openness.

In a nutshell, this is why *I love the internet*.
