<p>I had this idea to make <a href="http://robinwinslow.co.uk">my homepage</a> actually just an index of all my online profiles - a link to Facebook, a link to Github, a link to this Tumblr blog etc. - Partly to comply with the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/RelMeAuth">relMeAuth microformat</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>It seems to me a good way to do this would be to have really big icons. Everyone recognises the Facebook "F", or the Twitter bird. So I went in search of really big Icons.</p>&#13;
<p>Then I remembered about SVG.</p>&#13;
<p><!-- more --></p>&#13;
<p>SVG, for those who don't know, stands for "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">Scalable Vector Graphic</a>", and is a format for describing images in terms of paths rather than pixels, meaning that the definition of an image will be exactly the same no matter how big it is. E.g.:</p>&#13;
<p><code>&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1"&gt;<br /><span>  &lt;circle cx="100" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black"</span><br /><span>  stroke-width="2" fill="red" /&gt;</span><br /><span>&lt;/svg&gt;</span></code></p>&#13;
<p>(stolen from the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/svg/default.asp">w3schools.com</a> tutorial)</p>&#13;
<p>This would be ideal for large icons, because you would never lose quality no matter how big they were, and also I could allow the images to scale perfectly to fit your screen size. And you can put SVG code <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/html5/html5_svg.htm">directly in an HTML5 document</a> without having to have a separate file.</p>&#13;
<p>After a bit of a search I discovered <a href="http://nikalyuk.in/">someone who had already done this</a> with his homepage (although he hadn't used the awesome scaling power of the images), providing most of the icons I would need myself. So I duly stole them.</p>&#13;
<p>I had a bit of trouble trying to work out how to actually change the size of the SVG within an HTML5 document, but <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8515524/how-do-i-scale-an-svg-polygon-in-ems">stackoverflow came to the rescue</a>. My conclusion was that every SVG element should have a "viewBox" defined, but that they should *never* explicitly define the "width" or "height":</p>&#13;
<p><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;<br />&lt;html&gt;<br />&lt;body&gt;<br />&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 100 100"&gt;...&lt;/svg&gt;<br />&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</code></p>&#13;
<p>So now I can scale my SVG based on the CSS rules, which might say something like:</p>&#13;
<p><code>svg {width:30%;}</code></p>&#13;
<p>And everything will be fine. *satisfied sigh*.</p>
