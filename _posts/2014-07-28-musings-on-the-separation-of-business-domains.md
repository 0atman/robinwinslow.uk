["Why Poor Schools Canâ€™t Win at Standardized Testing"][atlantic-standardised-tests] highlights the problem of the same corporations producing both standardised tests and selling the text books. So they have an incentive to make sure you have an advantage if you buy the book, and a further incentive to change the test each year - making tests much harder if you don't buy their text books.

It occurs to me that this is the same as the problems with many areas of capitalism. The social benefit of competition falls down when a company has control over two codependent domains. It's a core principle in the recent [Net Neutrality][wikipedia-net-neutrality] debate - ISPs shouldn't be allowed to sell priority to online service providers as well as selling internet connections to the public - it'll be bad for competition and for the public's access to online services. ISPs should have the specific task of providing the utility of an internet connection. Another great example is the [separation of investment banking from personal savings][independent-bank-separation] to prevent people's savings being exposed to too much risk.

The problem is most obvious in the financial interests of politicians - who shouldn't be allowed to benefit, directly or indirectly, from any of the effects of the policies they enact, but often do. But it occurs to me that there should be some guiding principle to make sure this separation of interests is preserved throughout companies too.

Just as companies shouldn't be allowed to grow too big, they also shouldn't be allowed to control related domains. I believe this was the idea behind the [royal charter][wikipedia-charter], which is a license to operate an organisation within a specific domain.

However, this is far easier said than done. With the pace of change in the modern world, legislation could never keep up with all the new industries that are being created, and their evolving interrelations. And even if they could, people in similar industries always socialise together and create nepotistic relationships.

I suspect the only real solution is the most difficult - to engender a social conscience within organisations. Make it profitable, or at least morally beneficial, to create small, focussed organisations, that do one thing very well and take pride in it. I think this could potentially be achieved through thousands of small changes to benefit the small organisation. Like Net Neutrality, each piece of legislation that makes it harder to make a quick buck without producing real social value is a step in the right direction, and a guard against the sprawling, exploitative multinational corporations.
