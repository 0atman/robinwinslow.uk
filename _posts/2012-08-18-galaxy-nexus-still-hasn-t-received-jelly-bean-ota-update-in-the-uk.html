<p>A friend of mine just ordered a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_nexus">Google Nexus</a> from Amazon (for about £300 I think). Even though it's now almost exactly 9 months since the phone was <a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/880052-samsung-galaxy-nexus-uk-release-date-announced-as-november-17">released in the UK</a>, it's still the latest official Google phone and a very attractive package for the price.</p>&#13;
<p>One of the real advantages of a Google phone is of course that you're the first to get official Android updates, e.g. the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelly_Bean_(operating_system)#Android_4.1.x_Jelly_Bean">Jelly Bean release</a>. But even though the update was released over the air to Nexus 7 at the beginning of July, the Galaxy Nexus didn't update to it.</p>&#13;
<p><!-- more --></p>&#13;
<p>We spent ages trying to work out if there was something wrong with the phone. We discovered that there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_nexus#Variants">multiple variations</a> of the phone, and that his variant is the GT-i9250, which is the international HSPA+ model. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/18795711">According to the BBC</a>, this model should have been the first type of Galaxy Nexus to receive the new update.</p>&#13;
<p>Eventually we thought to look at the official support channels, and found that in fact Google has an absolutely <a href="http://support.google.com/nexus/bin/request.py?contact_type=contact_policy">fantastic Call Back feature</a> for support of Nexus devices. After being on hold for less than a minute my friend spent about 15 minutes trying a couple of solutions with the support of the very friendly support people, before discovering that in fact <strong>Jelly Bean has not been pushed to any Galaxy Nexus devices in the UK yet</strong>, but that it should be pushed soon.</p>&#13;
<p>I'm a bit disappointed with how far the UK seems to be behind the US in getting this release, but very impressed with the level of support Google offer for their device.</p>
