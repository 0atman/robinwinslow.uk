<p>So, having just accompanied my blog on <a href="http://blog.robinwinslow.co.uk/post/37412613737/a-blogs-existential-quest">its existential quest</a> I have decided to start writing down rambling thoughts just for the process of solidifying them in my mind - and not worry about their quality as prose.</p>&#13;
<p>Further to that, I have something I want to solidify.</p>&#13;
<p>I've been working in the offices of <a href="http://www.sessiondigital.com/">Session Digital</a> today. Every Friday, <a href="https://twitter.com/_md">Marcello</a> runs a "code workshop" for an hour at the end of the day, which I chose to attend. The purpose of this workshop is to encourage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process">Continuous Improvement</a> techniques to help coders improve the code they write.</p>&#13;
<p><!-- more --></p>&#13;
<p>His philosophy for this is based around the Japanese word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata">Kata</a>, which means "form" and as far as I can tell from the very brief introduction I was given is about building good technique as habit through repetition, so you don't even need to think about it.</p>&#13;
<p>The repetition in question is repetition of performing coding while conforming to the rules of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test-</a> (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">Behaviour-</a>) Driven Development and of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming_practices#Simple_design">Simple Design</a>, while also working in pairs. We are given a programming problem to solve, and then asked to solve it over and over again, trying to refine our "Form/Kata".</p>&#13;
<p>Rules of TDD (if these don't make much sense, go read more about TDD):</p>&#13;
<ul><li>You may not write code except to make a failing test pass</li>&#13;
<li>You may only write a test until you have a failing state</li>&#13;
<li>You may only write code until you have made the test pass</li>&#13;
</ul><p>Rules of Simple Design:</p>&#13;
<ul><li>All test must pass before you may refactor/simplify code</li>&#13;
<li>There should be no code duplication</li>&#13;
<li>Code should be as expressive as possible</li>&#13;
<li>Code should be as simple as possible (eliminate complexity)</li>&#13;
</ul><p>That is all for now.</p>
