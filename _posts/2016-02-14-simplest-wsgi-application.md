I often find myself wanting to play around with a tiny Python web application
with native Python without installing any extra modules -
the Python developer's equivalent of creating an `index.html` and opening it
in the browser [just to play around with markup][].

For example, today I found myself wanting to inspect how the
[Google API Client Library for Python][] handles requests, and a simple
application server was all I needed.

In these situations, the following minimal WSGI application, using the built-in
[wsgiref library][] is just the ticket:

``` python
from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server


def application(env, start_response):
    """
    A basic WSGI application
    """

    http_status = '200 OK'
    response_headers = [('Content-Type', 'text/html')]
    response_text = "Hello World"

    start_response(http_status, response_headers)
    return [response_text]

make_server('', 8000, application).serve_forever()
```

Put this in a file - e.g. `wsgi.py` - and run it with:

``` bash
$ python wsgi.py
127.0.0.1 - - [14/Feb/2016 16:22:38] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 11
```

(I've also saved this [as a Gist][]).

This provides you with a very raw way of parsing HTTP requests. All the
HTTP variables come in as items in the `env` dictionary. So `env['PATH_INFO']`
will tell you the requested path
(the `/index.html` in `http://example.com/index.html`),
and `env['QUERY_STRING']` will get you any query parameters
(the `foo=bar` in `http://example.com/index.html?foo=bar`).

What I often do from here is use [ipdb][] to inspect incoming requests, or
directly manipulate the response headers or content.

Alternatively, if you're looking for something slightly more full-featured
(but still very lightweight) [try Flask][].
