description: an exploration of how to create space in work

Sometime before the start of the millennium water companies decided that open plan offices for the future. It is well documented at this point that's traditional individual offices are much more productive.

This doesn't just apply to office organisation. Agile software development attempts to maximise resources by breaking down work into small chunks and then trying to rush through them in in sprints.

There are in fact many areas of life where are increased space in a way that appears inefficient in fact leads to superior solutions. For example simply being idle taking up your time in other pursuits turns out to be surprisingly efficient in the long run.

New media is a similarly instructive case study about 5 years ago there was a lot of buzz about the idea of slow news. People had realised that modern social media and the always online nature of modern life had made it difficult for people to focus on any one topic for any period of time. This was clearly leading to 20 quick shallow takes of modern events without deep analysis. Slough news attempts to address this by covering news stories that may not be by in the current conversation but with depth and space to fully explore the topic. I haven't heard anything about slow news for a number of years and if anything things have only got worse.
